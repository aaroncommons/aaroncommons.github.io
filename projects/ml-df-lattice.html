<h1>Machine-Learning Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory on a Lattice</h1>

<h3>Project Context and Objective</h3>
<p>
Accurately modelling the time evolution of a system of interacting particles is a fundamental 
challenge in physics. Many body systems, including the gravitational interactions of celestial 
bodies, the behaviour of molecules in a gas, and quantum systems, exhibit complex, nonlinear 
behaviour arising from particle interactions. As the system size increases, direct numerical 
simulation becomes exponentially more computationally expensive, prompting the use of reduced 
representations and data-driven modelling approaches.
My undergraduate thesis investigated the use of machine learning to predict the time evolution 
of a many-body quantum system defined on a lattice. The objective was to assess the capabilities 
of a trained neural network on a reduced representation of the system, enabling investigation of 
a scaled system without the associated computational cost. This would provide a more efficient tool 
than direct numerical simulations of the system.

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Using Python, I developed a numerical simulation of the interacting particle system based on 
        the governing many-body equations.</li>
    <li>Generated a dataset for the time evolution of the system for a range of evenly sampled initial 
        conditions.</li>
    <li>Trained a neural network to predict the system&#39;s time evolution directly from its initial state.</li>
    <li>Evaluated the performance of the model using a reduced representation of the system to improve the 
        computational efficiency.</li>
    <li>Investigated the influence of varying the interaction strength between particles on the predictive 
        accuracy of the model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Successfully trained a neural network to accurately predict the time evolution of the system given 
        a set of initial conditions.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated that for the reduced representation of the system, the predictive accuracy of the model 
        was significantly reduced. The model must be trained on an increased number of timesteps to make accurate 
        long-term predictions.</li>
    <li>By varying the relative interaction strength between the particles in the model, it was shown that the 
        intermediate interaction regime exhibited the most chaotic particle behaviour that was most difficult 
        for the ML model to predict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transferable Engineering Skills</h3>
<p>
Although this project is rooted in theoretical physics, it has developed several skills that are directly 
applicable to a simulation and modelling engineering role:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transferring a mathematical model into a Python-based numerical tool.</li>
    <li>Validating the numerical model against expected physical behaviour.</li>
    <li>Generating and processing large datasets from simulations.</li>
    <li>Designing, training and evaluating a neural network for a time series prediction task.</li>
</ul>
